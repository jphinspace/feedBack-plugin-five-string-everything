# Chart Retuner

A [feedBack](https://github.com/got-feedBack/feedBack) plugin that lets a
bass or guitar player play **any** chart, in any source tuning (Drop D,
Drop C#, whatever), by remapping each note to the correct string/fret for
a target tuning of your choice instead of the chart's original tuning.
Notes outside a target instrument's range are dropped.

> **Disclaimer:** the mapping is not perfect. A remapped chart may not
> sound exactly like the original (notes can land in different octaves,
> chords may be revoiced or simplified, and out-of-range notes are
> dropped), and it may be more difficult to play than the original
> arrangement. If you have suggestions for improving the mapping, please
> [submit an issue](https://github.com/jphinspace/feedBack-plugin-chart-retuner/issues).

## How it works

Chart Retuner registers as a **chart-transform provider**
([feedBack#952](https://github.com/got-feedBack/feedBack/issues/952)) — a
core capability that substitutes the chart's notes, chords, hand-position
anchors, chord templates, string count, and tuning/capo before both
rendering and scoring. That means the remap applies no matter which
visualization you have picked (the built-in 2D highway, 3D Highway, or any
other viz plugin), and any scorer (note_detect) that reads chart data
through `highway.getNotes()`/`getChords()` judges against the remapped
chart rather than the original.

A **Retuning active** toggle in the plugin's settings turns this off (play
every chart in its original tuning) without uninstalling the plugin.

## Target tunings

Each arrangement class has its own tuning profile, configurable in the
plugin's settings (Target Tunings section) and switchable at any time —
even mid-song:

- **Bass arrangements** default to **EADG** (standard 4-string bass).
- **Lead** and **Rhythm/other guitar** arrangements default to **EADGBE**
  (standard 6-string guitar). "Combo" and plain "Guitar" arrangements use
  the Rhythm profile.

All three profiles pick from the same pool of tunings — any pitches, 4 to
8 strings — so a guitarist can keep one tuning for rhythm charts and
another for lead, and nothing stops you from pointing a guitar profile at
a bass tuning or vice versa:

- **Bass (EADG)** (default for bass)
- **Bass (BEADG)**
- **Guitar (EADGBE)** (default for lead/rhythm)
- **Guitar (BEADGBE)**
- **Baritone Guitar (BEADF#B)**
- **Upright bass solo (F#BEA)**
- **Cello (CGDA)**
- **Viola (CGDA)**
- **Violin (GDAE)**
- **Banjo 4-string (CGBD)**
- **Banjo 5-string (gDGBD)**
- **Ukulele (gCEA)**
- **Baritone ukulele (DGBE)**
- **Mandolin (GGDDAAEE)**
- **Your own saved custom profiles**

Every saved tuning carries its own fixed per-string colors, set via a
per-string color picker when you create or edit it — shown in the tuning
editor for visual reference; whether they drive a renderer's own coloring
depends on that renderer.

Every tuning also carries its own **max fret** (12, 14, 20, 21, 22, or 24)
— the highest fret a chart is allowed to remap onto for that instrument.
Set your own custom tunings' max fret when you create or edit them.

## Capo & octave offset

Two per-tuning adjustments on top of the string pitches themselves
(both default to 0 on every built-in preset):

- **Capo** — clamp a virtual capo on any fret from 1 to (max fret − 1).
  One fret = one half-step up per string; the frets above
  (max fret − capo) fall off the end of the neck, and the nut labels
  show the capo'd pitches. Tune every string down a half-step and capo
  fret 1 and you get the exact original chart back — the cumulative
  offset is zero.
- **Octave offset** — shift the whole chart up or down 1-2 octaves
  before remapping, with no key change. **+1** plays an E-standard bass
  chart on a standard guitar's lowest four strings note-for-note; **-1**
  is the reverse. Save +1 on a cello profile and every bass chart plays
  an octave up by default.

Both live in two places:

- **Player controls** — a *Capo* and an *Octave* slider in the player
  chrome (the plugin controls that appear at the left edge of the
  screen), for quick per-song changes. These apply live mid-song and
  persist **per tuning**, so a capo you set while playing on EADGBE
  doesn't follow you to the cello preset.
- **The tuning editor** — saved with a custom tuning as its defaults
  (for a capo you never take off). A later editor save clears any
  player-controls override for that tuning so the saved values take
  effect.

## Chords

Single notes always keep their exact sounding pitch (or drop when the
target instrument can't reach them). Chords get smarter treatment,
because open and barre shapes don't map note-for-note across tunings.
When the exact note-for-note mapping of a chord is playable, it's used
as-is; when it isn't, the chord is **revoiced** on the target tuning —
same chord (same notes-of-the-chord, octaves may shuffle) — following
these priorities, in order:

1. **Playable** — no stretches wider than a 4-fret box (unless the
   original chart chord stretched further) and never more than 4 fretting
   fingers, barres included.
2. **Comparable hand shape** — open-position chords stay open-ish and the
   hand stays near the original fret position; a barre is never
   introduced where the chart had none if a better option exists.
3. **Root in the bass** — preferred, but an inversion or a simplified
   voicing wins when it fits priorities 1-2 better.

When no full voicing fits, the chord simplifies progressively (drop
doubled notes → triad → power chord → single root note) rather than
disappearing. Chord diagrams and hand-shape highlights follow the
remapped voicing; the chord *name* still shows the chart's original
label.

## Install

**Option A — feedback-desktop plugin manager:** add this repo's URL
(`https://github.com/jphinspace/feedBack-plugin-chart-retuner.git`) in the
plugin manager. It installs under the repo name verbatim.

**Option B — manual copy:** clone or copy this repo's contents into your
feedBack install's `plugins/` directory, e.g.:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jphinspace/feedBack-plugin-chart-retuner.git /path/to/feedBack/plugins/feedBack-plugin-chart-retuner
```

Restart feedBack (or reload plugins) after installing. Retuning activates
automatically on first install (see the **Retuning active** toggle above
to turn it off).

## Build

No build step for `screen.js` itself — it's plain JS, no bundler. The
Tailwind stylesheet (`assets/plugin.css`) is prebuilt and committed; only
regenerate it if you add Tailwind classes to `screen.js`/`settings.html`:

```sh
bash build-tailwind.sh
```

**Tests** (the string/fret remap engine only — pure functions, no browser/DOM):

```sh
node test/retune-engine.test.mjs
node test/chord-solver.test.mjs
```
